### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Jeremy and I love coding and producing applications that fill a gap in the technologies I deploy and support that enhance the user experience. Absolutely anyone can code, and my passion is to drive this within the IT Pro community.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on...
- Computer Restart Service to manage the computer uptime (designed for Session Hosts, but can be used on any computer/VM).
- VDA Helper Service to manage the starting of the service.
- Self-Service Session Reset Tool for the Help Desk.
- Citrix Workspace Swiss Army Knife (a tool to help users start Explorer and other utilities from a Seamless App session)

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything.

Thanks for visiting!
