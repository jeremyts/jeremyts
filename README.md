### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Jeremy and I love coding and producing applications that fill a gap in the technologies I deploy and support that enhance the user experience. Absolutely anyone can code, and my passion is to drive this within the IT Pro community.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on...
- Computer Restart Service
- VDA Helper Service
- Self-Service Session Reset Tool for the Help Desk

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything.
